## MW Compiler Reference Doc
This site servers as a reference for information regarding versions of the Metrowerks Codewarrior compilers for PS2. It's intended to serve as a handy reference to help identify the different versions of the compiler and the verison numbers built into the compiled binaries.

 Thanks to BenoitRen for creating the website.
